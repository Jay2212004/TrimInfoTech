Explanation
HTML & CSS: A simple, responsive login form is created.
JavaScript: Basic client-side validation is implemented.
Python (Flask):
Passwords are hashed using bcrypt.
Sessions are managed securely with Flask's session management.
Users are redirected to a dashboard upon successful login and can log out to destroy the session.
Security Best Practices
Password Hashing: Passwords are hashed using bcrypt to prevent storing plain text passwords.
Session Management: Flask's session is used with a secret key to sign the session cookies.
Input Validation: Basic validation is done on the client-side and should also be validated on the server-side.
Secure Cookies: Use secure flags for cookies in a production environment (e.g., session_cookie_secure, session_cookie_http_only).
Prevent CSRF: Implement CSRF tokens to prevent cross-site request forgery.
This setup provides a foundation for a secure login page, but further enhancements and security measures should be considered for a production environment, such as using HTTPS, implementing more comprehensive validation and sanitization, and integrating with a secure database.
